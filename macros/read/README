DATA FORMAT:

../../NLOmtpole/ttj_mu1/mt166/dist.mt166_CT10_mu1_pt50_10000.born_gg.out
(where 10000 is VEGAS POINTS, born is the order of the process, gg is the process)

##############
#Check stats
# we need to modify the mt and scale in the .C files
## 1st -->

root -l checkstats_running.C+

#It plots the uncertainty and relative uncertainties of each process for a given mass and scale. The reference should be the born processes. In general, processes with relative uncertainty < 10.^-3 are suspicious to need more statistis. (The real answer will only get obtained when plotting the distribtuion, bin by bin, for different masses and scales --> if the curves are not smooth, more statistics ins needed.

## 2nd -->
root -l checkprecision.C+

#This macro compares the relative uncertainties of the three different scale calculations. The reason is that the scale 0.5 usually has poor conversion. The scale mu=mt converges nicely and with VEGAS 30000 is more than okay. (Can be used as reference)



#################
# Text FILE to ROOT file conversion:
# These macros read 24 text file and save 1 root file and 1 text file with the merging of the 24 processes.

## 1st -->
root -l readPUoutput_runningNLO.C+

#converts all 24 process for given mass/scale (modify it in the file). It plots the following message:
#              File Ok, n3 (atlas) distribution found ../../NLOmtpole/ttj_mu05/mt166/dist.mt166_CT10_mu05_pt50_10000.subtractions_proc24.out
#if the file was complete.
## IMPORTANT !! if you don't see this, it means that the calculation stopped at some point --> you need to relaunch it.

## 2nd -->
root -l readPUoutput_runningLO.C+

#The expected file naming is:
#../../LOmtpole/dist.LO.mt166_plus05_CT10_mu05_pt50_10000.born_gg.out (plus05, minus05 and nothing). In this case, the mass of the calculation is 166.5, but the scale is 166/2, not 166.5/2. This is the right way to do it.

## 3rd -->
root -l readPUoutput_runningNLO_sigma.C+

#Similar to the NLO but only for inclusive cross sections.
#It only produces logfiles, not rootfiles.
